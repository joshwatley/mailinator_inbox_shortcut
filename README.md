# MAILINATOR INBOX SHORTCUT

SHORTCUT : CTRL + ALT + P 

This shortcut allows you to copy any valid @mailinator.com email address and open straight to the inbox on shortcut press.


### OPTIONS:

* Change the PATH_TO_CHROME const in file to the correct browser location you would like to open the inbox in. 
* You can also change the command shortcut to whatever you would like using the SHORTCUT_VAL const.
* Rename the file extension to pyw in order to run this lightweight programme in the background without having the console show.
